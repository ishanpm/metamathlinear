Implementation of linear logic in Metamath

This is mostly a personal excercise in writing definitions and proofs in Metamath, as well as an excercise in getting an intuition for linear logic. However, you are welcome to use this database however you see fit.

There are currently several statements with no proof given. This is because I am still trying to decide on a good order and naming convention for the proofs. Once I settle on a system for arranging and naming the proofs, I'll fill those in.

## Usage

First, install Metamath from http://us.metamath.org/. Run makeHtml.bat from within the html directory, or run the equivalent commands from the Metamath console. You can then view mmtheorems.html in a web browser to browse the theroems and their proofs.
